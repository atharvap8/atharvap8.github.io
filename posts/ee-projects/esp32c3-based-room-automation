This project involves creating a room automation system using the ESP32-C3 microcontroller. 
The ESP32-C3 is a low-power, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-enabled microcontroller that is ideal for IoT applications.

The room automation system can control various devices such as lights, fans, and sensors through a web interface or mobile app.
The system is also integrated with voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant for hands-free control.
