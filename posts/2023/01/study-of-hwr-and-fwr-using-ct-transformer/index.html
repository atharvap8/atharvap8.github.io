It consists of a diode that is connected in series with the load resistor and an AC source. The diode only allows current to flow in one direction, i.e., from the anode to cathode.

It is composed of diodes that allow the current to flow in only one direction, which is from the anode to the cathode. The center-tapped transformer is used to derive two equal and opposite polarities from the AC source. The two half-cycles of the AC voltage are fed to the diodes and the resulting output is a continuous DC voltage.</p></li><li><p>In a full-wave rectifier, both positive and negative half-cycles of the AC voltage are utilized. During the positive half-cycle of the AC voltage, the diode connected to the positive half of the secondary winding of the transformer conducts and the diode connected to the negative half remains non-conducting. During the negative half-cycle, the situation is reversed. This results in a continuous DC voltage output, which is the average value of the AC voltage.</p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=during-positive-half-cycle->During Positive Half-Cycle 👇🏻</h4><figure><img src=/img/fwr+.gif></figure><hr><h4 id=during-negative-half-cycle->During Negative Half-Cycle 👇🏻</h4><figure><img src=/img/fwr-.gif></figure><hr><h4 id=advantages-1>Advantages</h4><ul><li>The full-wave rectifier provides several advantages over the half-wave rectifier. The first advantage is that the output waveform is much smoother and more constant compared to the half-wave rectifier. This makes the full-wave rectifier more suitable for applications where a steady DC voltage is required, such as charging batteries, powering DC motors, and regulating voltage.</li><li>Another advantage of the full-wave rectifier is that it has a higher efficiency compared to the half-wave rectifier. The full-wave rectifier utilizes both the positive and negative half-cycles of the AC voltage, whereas the half-wave rectifier only uses one half-cycle. This results in a higher average output voltage, which leads to a higher efficiency.</li><li>Additionally, the full-wave rectifier has a lower ripple voltage compared to the half-wave rectifier. The ripple voltage is the alternating voltage that is present in the DC output voltage. A lower ripple voltage means that the output voltage is smoother and more stable, which is important in applications where a steady voltage is required.</li></ul><hr><h4 id=conclusion-2>Conclusion</h4><p>In conclusion, the full-wave rectifier provides a more stable, efficient, and steady DC voltage compared to the half-wave rectifier.
