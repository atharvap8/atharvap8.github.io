With full access to all internal components (motor, valves, sensors), this project became an intensive 1-year journey through reverse engineering, signal probing, embedded firmware design, IoT integration, mechanical testing, and finally full automation.</p><hr><h2 id=-complete-disassembly--mechanical-understanding>🔧 Complete Disassembly & Mechanical Understanding</h2><ul><li><p>First I started by taking the entire drum and motor assembly apart. I literally removed every component and part, such as the suspension arms, The Drain Motor assembly, the gearbox transmission system, The motor assembly.</p></li><li><p>The top cover was removed, and the required wiring connectors were disconnected, so as to completely separate the top housing cover. Then the drum assembly was taken out.</p></li><li><p>What I did afterwards is, I had a 3 phase VFD (Variable Frequency Drive). Using it, I started to test the motor with various frequecies, and observed the RPM of the motor at different frequency.</p></li><li><p>Next test was to properly test if the drum brake disengage mechanism was working or not. To test it, I had to apply 12 V to the drain Motor. There i realized, it had 3 pins, 1 is GND (Ground), 2 is Wash Mode, 3 is Spin Mode.</p></li><li><p>By applying 12V DC to specified terminal, i tested the drain motor. And confirmed that the drum also starts to spin.</p></li></ul><figure><img src=/img/aiotwm/drainmotor.jpeg alt="Drain Motor" width=800px height=400px><figcaption><p>Drain Motor</p></figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id=-reverse-engineering-the-inverter-drive-module>🧠 Reverse Engineering the Inverter Drive Module</h2><figure><img src=/img/aiotwm/module.jpg alt="Inverter Drive Module (Model: ISB-LC4-3050_V2)" width=900px height=500px><figcaption><p><strong><em>Inverter Drive Module (Model: ISB-LC4-3050_V2)</em></strong></p></figcaption></figure><ul><li><p>Before connecting the module to anything, I conducted a thorough short-circuit and continuity test on the IPM board to ensure that it hadn’t suffered damage or latent failures. Only after verifying its integrity did I proceed with functional testing.</p></li><li><p>The inverter module contains an Infineon IGCM04G60HA Intelligent Power Module (<a href=https://eepower.com/technical-articles/intelligent-power-modules-ipms-concepts-features-and-applications title="Detailed Info"><strong>IPM</strong></a>) along with a Renesas UPD78F1201 16-bit microcontroller, originally used in Samsung dual-door refrigerators to control the BLDC compressor motor.</p></li><li><p>I began reverse engineering the control logic by tracing the input terminals and signal paths on the board. It was quickly evident that this module was far more sophisticated than a basic relay driver — it had full embedded PWM-based motor control logic built into the microcontroller.</p></li><li><p>The IPM requires an external 325V DC power rail, typically obtained by rectifying and filtering the 230V AC mains using a high-voltage bridge rectifier and bulk electrolytic capacitors. This high-voltage rail is then switched across the motor windings using high-side and low-side IGBTs inside the IPM, forming a standard three-phase inverter topology.</p></li><li><p>One of the unique behaviors I discovered during testing was the module’s built-in soft-start delay: it waits for nearly 10 minutes after power is applied before automatically enabling motor output. This likely replicates the refrigeration compressor’s anti-short-cycling feature. After the wait, the board autonomously initialized and began spinning the motor, confirming that it was operational.</p></li><li><p>During this process, I connected the motor externally and used a series filament lamp to limit inrush current and provide a visual cue for abnormal current draw — a tried-and-tested method in electronics repair. This prevented catastrophic failure in case of internal shorts or miswiring.</p></li><li><p>The motor began spinning smoothly with considerable torque — to the extent that I could not stop it by hand. The board was operating as expected, safely handling the start-up, speed regulation, and directional switching.</p></li></ul><h2 id=-understanding-motor-drive-logic-3-phase-inverter-motor>⚙️ Understanding Motor Drive Logic (3-Phase Inverter Motor)</h2><ul><li>The motor was a typical 3-Phase UVW Motor, with a rated Voltage of 310V DC. Also it was specially designed for LG.</li></ul><figure><img src=/img/aiotwm/uvwmotor.jpg alt="BLDC Motor - (Part No. WDC0150Y1M)" width=400px height=250px><figcaption><p><strong>BLDC Motor - (Part No. WDC0150Y1M)</strong></p></figcaption></figure><ul><li><p>Once the motor was verified to run standalone, I mounted it inside the washing machine drum and connected it to the mechanical assembly responsible for spin and wash motion. This allowed me to test realistic load behavior.</p></li><li><p>I loaded the drum with wet clothes and triggered a spin sequence. The motor was powerful enough to sustain the load without stalling — demonstrating that the Samsung IPM board’s output stage was capable of delivering commercial-level torque, even under load conditions typical for a full spin cycle.</p></li><li><p>I studied the motor’s feedback and control wiring in more detail. It used a 4-pin connector, <strong>responsible for:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Providing Motor RPM (Speed) Values (using Feedback)</em></li><li><em>Providing PWM Speed Control to the IPM board</em></li><li><em>Sending Fault Status and Response Codes</em></li></ul></li><li><p>The core of the operation lies in the alternating high-voltage switching of the three-phase windings, based on precise rotor position sensing. This allows the motor to operate in synchronous mode, with smooth startup, speed variation, and directional control.</p></li></ul><figure><img src=/img/aiotwm/modblkdia.png alt="Inverter Drive Module (Model: ISB-LC4-3050_V2) Block Diagram" width=900px height=500px><figcaption><p><strong><em>Inverter Drive Module (Model: ISB-LC4-3050_V2) Block Diagram</em></strong></p></figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id=-prototyping-with-arduino-uno>🧪 Prototyping with Arduino UNO</h2><ul><li>To test manual control over the IPM board, I designed a basic PWM signal generator using an Arduino UNO. The idea was to simulate the kind of PWM signals the original fridge controller might have sent to the IPM board.</li></ul><p><strong>Video Link:</strong> <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPNWp27gQstlgL91O9z6UTNsfqDp0jNiJFLL1oh2fxKv0CKhDPo4cSU1hQcb7W5Ug/photo/AF1QipNVxxiq89uGjgkWxa-xYKltjGWV_kP-2nztHGkK?key=WE9fbWNub0hjMVVGcDI5YVAwNG5lRzgwblA3Qm1B"><strong>Click Here</strong></a></p><ul><li><p>The PWM signal was routed through an optocoupler to safely interface the 5V Arduino with the IPM’s control logic. This allowed me to control motor start/stop by sending short PWM bursts after the initial soft-start period.</p></li><li><p>Next, I experimented with variable PWM duty cycles and frequency modulation. This helped test the motor speed control behavior — I could observe changes in spin RPM as I adjusted the duty cycle from ~20% to ~90%.</p></li><li><p>This step confirmed that the motor’s speed could be externally controlled via software-generated PWM, laying the groundwork for future integration with the ESP32, which would replace the Arduino in the final system.</p></li><li><p>The prototype circuit also included simple time delay routines to prevent sudden starts, giving the inverter enough time to safely initialize before sending control signals.</p></li></ul><hr><h2 id=-actuator-testing--verification>🔌 Actuator Testing & Verification</h2><ul><li><p>To ensure that each electromechanical component of the washing machine functioned independently and predictably, I began by testing the actuators one by one using a bench power supply set to 12V DC. This direct testing allowed me to characterize their behavior under controlled conditions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inlet Valve Solenoid:</strong>
Applying 12V to the inlet valve triggered the internal solenoid, allowing water to flow through the valve — confirming its normal operation. This validated that the solenoid did not have internal clogs or sticking.

In this stage, a partial stroke of the drain motor disengages the half-drum brake, enabling gentle rotation for washing. On applying power, the actuator moved correctly to this intermediate position.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drain Motor – Stage 2 (Spin Mode):</strong><br>A longer actuation engaged the drain motor fully, which completely disengaged the drum brake, allowing high-speed rotation for spin cycles. This also worked reliably and repeatedly.</p></li></ul><p>These tests formed the foundation for mapping the mechanical behavior of the machine&rsquo;s internal mechanisms with external electrical control, enabling fully customized programming of future washing sequences.</p><hr><h2 id=-closed-loop-water-level-regulation>🔄 Closed-Loop Water Level Regulation</h2><p>To automate water level management, I initially explored both analog and digital pressure sensing techniques. While analog sensors lacked precision and required additional ADC circuitry, most commercial digital pressure sensors were expensive and difficult to source.</p><ul><li>After some research, I discovered the <strong>HX710B</strong>, a pressure sensor IC derived from the popular HX711 load cell amplifier family. Though not originally intended for environmental sensing, the HX710B has a differential ADC interface capable of measuring small voltage differences with high resolution — making it suitable for repurposing as a water-level pressure sensor.</li></ul><figure><img src=/img/aiotwm/aps.jpg alt="HX710B Air Pressure Sensor" width=300px height=300px><figcaption><p>HX710B Air Pressure Sensor</p></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Test Setup:</strong></p><ul><li><p>I connected the HX710B to a small air trap chamber — this chamber is connected to the bottom of the drum via a sealed air tube.</p></li><li><p>As the water fills the drum, the air inside the trap compresses, increasing the internal pressure, which is detected by the HX710B module.</p></li><li><p>A simple Arduino sketch continuously read the digital values from the HX710B and compared them against predefined setpoints.</p></li><li><p>Calibration was performed manually using graduated containers to add specific volumes of water. I logged corresponding sensor readings to correlate digital values with actual water levels (e.g., 6L, 12L, 18L).</p></li></ul><hr><h2 id=-transitioning-to-esp32-platform>🔁 Transitioning to ESP32 Platform</h2><ul><li>Once the core testing of motor control and actuator behavior was completed, I shifted focus to building a more intelligent, fully programmable controller. This began with selecting the appropriate microcontroller platform.</li></ul><p><strong>Microcontroller Selection:</strong></p><ul><li>After estimating the number of GPIOs required for relay modules, sensors, communication interfaces, and feedback mechanisms, I finalized the ESP32 as the brain of the system.</li></ul><p><strong>The ESP32 provided:</strong></p><ul><li>Dual-core processing for multitasking wash logic and communications.</li><li>Sufficient digital I/O and ADC inputs.</li><li>Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, enabling smart integration features.</li></ul><p><strong>Platform Setup and Firmware Development:</strong></p><ul><li>I opted for the ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) to build the firmware, ensuring full control and lower-level access compared to Arduino Core.</li></ul><p><strong>Initial libraries integrated:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>HX711/HX710B</strong> for water level sensing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Telegram Bot</strong> Library to push real-time updates to my personal Telegram bot.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wire / I2C / GPIO</strong> drivers for low-level control of peripherals.</p></li><li><p><strong>WebServer</strong> Library for Endpoint control, and OTA Update Framework.</p></li><li><p><strong>ElegantOTA</strong> Library for Backend OTA Handling.</p></li><li><p><strong>LiquidCrystalI2C</strong> Library for Displaying text on 16x2 LCD.</p></li><li><p><strong>Espalexa Library</strong> for Remote Device Control.</p></li><li><p>All control logic — including PWM generation, relay sequencing, safety interlocks, and mode switching — was implemented as tasks within the ESP32’s FreeRTOS framework.</p></li></ul><hr><h2 id=-mechanical-load-testing>🧱 Mechanical Load Testing</h2><ul><li>With firmware ready and control logic functional, I moved on to real-world mechanical stress testing to validate the full load capabilities of the inverter drive and the motor.</li></ul><p><strong>⚙️ Full Drum Load Testing:</strong></p><ul><li>I mounted the motor inside the washing drum, reassembled the mechanical linkage, and filled the drum with clothes and water to simulate real conditions.</li><li>Using different PWM duty cycles, I controlled the motor through wash, rinse, and spin modes.</li><li>Peak power output observed was approximately 350W sustained, with startup torque high enough that manual interruption was impossible — indicating the IPM was operating optimally.</li></ul><p><strong>🚨 Error Handling Observations:</strong></p><ul><li>During testing, unexpected shutdowns occurred. After careful diagnosis, I discovered a protection feature in the inverter module:</li><li>If a single changeover relay (used for phase reversal) was left ON while the inverter supply was active, the UVW outputs got shorted.</li><li>This triggered the IPM’s internal short-circuit protection (OCP), causing the module to shut down.</li><li>I updated the code logic to ensure relays disengage cleanly before power-down, preventing inadvertent fault conditions.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=-custom-pcb-design--wiring-integration>🧯 Custom PCB Design & Wiring Integration</h2><p>Once the electronics and code were verified on breadboards and modules, I moved to permanent installation inside the washing machine.</p><p><strong>Hardware Design and Assembly:</strong></p><p>Created a detailed schematic, including:</p><ul><li><p>Relay driver modules</p></li><li><p>Isolated optocoupler inputs for IPM signals</p></li><li><p>Buck converters for powering logic</p></li><li><p>Sensor headers for HX710B, inlet valve, and drain motor</p></li><li><p>Due to unavailability of quick-turn PCB fabrication services, I hand-built the board on a general-purpose zero PCB, following the schematic.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Testing & Installation:</strong></p><ul><li>All components were tested during assembly to ensure there were no solder bridges or open circuits.</li><li>I labeled each wire and crimped all terminal ends to ensure proper fit inside screw terminals.</li><li>Cutouts and holes were drilled into the top cover panel and a side-mounted junction box was added to house the control PCB safely.</li></ul><p><strong>Wiring Scheme:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>3 motor wires:</strong></p><ul><li>1 directly connected to the motor</li><li>2 routed through changeover relays to switch phases</li><li>2 wires to inverter drive:</li><li>Live (through relay NO + COM terminals)</li><li>Neutral (direct to inverter drive)</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Remaining relay channels controlled:</strong></p><ul><li>Drain Motor Stage 1</li><li>Drain Motor Stage 2</li><li>Inlet Valve</li><li>Changeover Relays</li></ul></li><li><p>For detailed wiring and notes, refer the schematic circuit diagram, and stock wiring diagram of the machine.</p></li></ul><hr><h2 id=-implemented-features>✅ Implemented Features</h2><ul><li>Basic Washing Programs</li><li>Water Level Sensing</li><li>Wi-Fi Enabled Control</li><li>Live Status Indication</li><li>Voice Assistant Integration</li><li>Web Dashboard Control</li><li>OTA Firmware Update</li><li>Partial Error Handling</li><li>Manual Control Panel</li><li>Status LEDs</li><li>Telegram Notification Bot</li><li>LCD Display Feedback</li></ul><hr><h2 id=-features-under-development>🛠️ Features Under Development</h2><ul><li>Countdown Timer Display</li><li>Emergency Inverter Stop</li><li>Custom IC-Based PCB Design</li><li>Custom Inverter Drive Design</li><li>Wash Cycle Memory Function</li><li>Auto Resume After Power Loss</li><li>Door Safety Interrupt</li><li>Load Sensing & Auto Balancing</li><li>Smart Error Diagnosis & Suggestions</li><li>AI Self-Diagnostic System</li><li>Test Mode (Self-Run)</li><li>AI-Based Laundry Type Detection</li><li>Dynamic Water Level by Load</li><li>Water Heater & Temperature Sensing</li></ul><hr><h2 id=-challenges--failures>⚠️ Challenges & Failures</h2><hr><h2 id=-final-system-behavior>🧼 Final System Behavior</h2><hr><h2 id=-gallery--media>🖼️ Gallery & Media</h2><hr><h2 id=-appendix--source-code>💾 Appendix & Source Code</h2></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
