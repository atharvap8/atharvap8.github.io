With full access to all internal components (motor, valves, sensors), this project became an intensive 1-year journey through reverse engineering, signal probing, embedded firmware design, IoT integration, mechanical testing, and finally full automation.</p><hr><hr><h2 id=-complete-disassembly--mechanical-understanding>🔧 Complete Disassembly & Mechanical Understanding</h2><ul><li><p>First I started by taking the entire drum and motor assembly apart. I literally removed every component and part, such as the suspension arms, The Drain Motor assembly, the gearbox transmission system, The motor assembly.</p></li><li><p>The top cover was removed, and the required wiring connectors were disconnected, so as to completely separate the top housing cover. Then the drum assembly was taken out.</p></li><li><p>What I did afterwards is, I had a 3 phase VFD (Variable Frequency Drive). Using it, I started to test the motor with various frequecies, and observed the RPM of the motor at different frequency.</p></li><li><p>Next test was to properly test if the drum brake disengage mechanism was working or not. To test it, I had to apply 12 V to the drain Motor. There i realized, it had 3 pins, 1 is GND (Ground), 2 is Wash Mode, 3 is Spin Mode.</p></li><li><p>By applying 12V DC to specified terminal, i tested the drain motor. And confirmed that the drum also starts to spin.</p></li></ul><figure><img src=/img/aiotwm/drainmotor.jpeg alt="Drain Motor" width=800px height=400px><figcaption><p>Drain Motor</p></figcaption></figure><hr><hr><h2 id=-reverse-engineering-the-inverter-drive-module>🧠 Reverse Engineering the Inverter Drive Module</h2><figure><img src=/img/aiotwm/module.jpg alt="Inverter Drive Module (Model: ISB-LC4-3050_V2)" width=900px height=500px><figcaption><p><strong><em>Inverter Drive Module (Model: ISB-LC4-3050_V2)</em></strong></p></figcaption></figure><ul><li><p>Before connecting the module to anything, I conducted a thorough short-circuit and continuity test on the IPM board to ensure that it hadn’t suffered damage or latent failures. Only after verifying its integrity did I proceed with functional testing.</p></li><li><p>The inverter module contains an Infineon IGCM04G60HA Intelligent Power Module (<a href=https://eepower.com/technical-articles/intelligent-power-modules-ipms-concepts-features-and-applications title="Detailed Info"><strong>IPM</strong></a>) along with a Renesas UPD78F1201 16-bit microcontroller, originally used in Samsung dual-door refrigerators to control the BLDC compressor motor.</p></li><li><p>I began reverse engineering the control logic by tracing the input terminals and signal paths on the board. It was quickly evident that this module was far more sophisticated than a basic relay driver — it had full embedded PWM-based motor control logic built into the microcontroller.</p></li><li><p>The IPM requires an external 325V DC power rail, typically obtained by rectifying and filtering the 230V AC mains using a high-voltage bridge rectifier and bulk electrolytic capacitors. This high-voltage rail is then switched across the motor windings using high-side and low-side IGBTs inside the IPM, forming a standard three-phase inverter topology.</p></li><li><p>One of the unique behaviors I discovered during testing was the module’s built-in soft-start delay: it waits for nearly 10 minutes after power is applied before automatically enabling motor output. This likely replicates the refrigeration compressor’s anti-short-cycling feature. After the wait, the board autonomously initialized and began spinning the motor, confirming that it was operational.</p></li><li><p>During this process, I connected the motor externally and used a series filament lamp to limit inrush current and provide a visual cue for abnormal current draw — a tried-and-tested method in electronics repair. This prevented catastrophic failure in case of internal shorts or miswiring.</p></li><li><p>The motor began spinning smoothly with considerable torque — to the extent that I could not stop it by hand. The board was operating as expected, safely handling the start-up, speed regulation, and directional switching.</p></li></ul><h2 id=-understanding-motor-drive-logic-3-phase-inverter-motor>⚙️ Understanding Motor Drive Logic (3-Phase Inverter Motor)</h2><ul><li>The motor was a typical 3-Phase UVW Motor, with a rated Voltage of 310V DC. Also it was specially designed for LG.</li></ul><figure><img src=/img/aiotwm/uvwmotor.jpg alt="BLDC Motor - (Part No. WDC0150Y1M)" width=400px height=250px><figcaption><p><strong>BLDC Motor - (Part No. WDC0150Y1M)</strong></p></figcaption></figure><ul><li><p>Once the motor was verified to run standalone, I mounted it inside the washing machine drum and connected it to the mechanical assembly responsible for spin and wash motion. This allowed me to test realistic load behavior.</p></li><li><p>I loaded the drum with wet clothes and triggered a spin sequence. The motor was powerful enough to sustain the load without stalling — demonstrating that the Samsung IPM board’s output stage was capable of delivering commercial-level torque, even under load conditions typical for a full spin cycle.</p></li><li><p>I studied the motor’s feedback and control wiring in more detail. It used a 4-pin connector, <strong>responsible for:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Providing Motor RPM (Speed) Values (using Feedback)</em></li><li><em>Providing PWM Speed Control to the IPM board</em></li><li><em>Sending Fault Status and Response Codes</em></li></ul></li><li><p>The core of the operation lies in the alternating high-voltage switching of the three-phase windings, based on precise rotor position sensing. This allows the motor to operate in synchronous mode, with smooth startup, speed variation, and directional control.</p></li></ul><figure><img src=/img/aiotwm/modblkdia.png alt="Inverter Drive Module (Model: ISB-LC4-3050_V2) Block Diagram" width=900px height=500px><figcaption><p><strong><em>Inverter Drive Module (Model: ISB-LC4-3050_V2) Block Diagram</em></strong></p></figcaption></figure><hr><hr><h2 id=-prototyping-with-arduino-uno>🧪 Prototyping with Arduino UNO</h2><ul><li>To test manual control over the IPM board, I designed a basic PWM signal generator using an Arduino UNO.

This allowed me to control motor start/stop by sending short PWM bursts after the initial soft-start period.</p></li><li><p>Next, I experimented with variable PWM duty cycles and frequency modulation. This helped test the motor speed control behavior — I could observe changes in spin RPM as I adjusted the duty cycle from ~20% to ~90%.</p></li><li><p>This step confirmed that the motor’s speed could be externally controlled via software-generated PWM, laying the groundwork for future integration with the ESP32, which would replace the Arduino in the final system.</p></li><li><p>The prototype circuit also included simple time delay routines to prevent sudden starts, giving the inverter enough time to safely initialize before sending control signals.</p></li></ul><hr><hr><h2 id=-actuator-testing--verification>🔌 Actuator Testing & Verification</h2><ul><li><p>To ensure that each electromechanical component of the washing machine functioned independently and predictably, I began by testing the actuators one by one using a bench power supply set to 12V DC. This direct testing allowed me to characterize their behavior under controlled conditions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inlet Valve Solenoid:</strong>
Applying 12V to the inlet valve triggered the internal solenoid, allowing water to flow through the valve — confirming its normal operation. This validated that the solenoid did not have internal clogs or sticking.

In this stage, a partial stroke of the drain motor disengages the half-drum brake, enabling gentle rotation for washing. On applying power, the actuator moved correctly to this intermediate position.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drain Motor – Stage 2 (Spin Mode):</strong><br>A longer actuation engaged the drain motor fully, which completely disengaged the drum brake, allowing high-speed rotation for spin cycles. This also worked reliably and repeatedly.</p></li></ul><p>These tests formed the foundation for mapping the mechanical behavior of the machine&rsquo;s internal mechanisms with external electrical control, enabling fully customized programming of future washing sequences.</p><hr><hr><h2 id=-closed-loop-water-level-regulation>🔄 Closed-Loop Water Level Regulation</h2><p>To automate water level management, I initially explored both analog and digital pressure sensing techniques. While analog sensors lacked precision and required additional ADC circuitry, most commercial digital pressure sensors were expensive and difficult to source.</p><ul><li>After some research, I discovered the <strong>HX710B</strong>, a pressure sensor IC derived from the popular HX711 load cell amplifier family. Though not originally intended for environmental sensing, the HX710B has a differential ADC interface capable of measuring small voltage differences with high resolution — making it suitable for repurposing as a water-level pressure sensor.</li></ul><figure><img src=/img/aiotwm/aps.jpg alt="HX710B Air Pressure Sensor" width=300px height=300px><figcaption><p>HX710B Air Pressure Sensor</p></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Test Setup:</strong></p><ul><li><p>I connected the HX710B to a small air trap chamber — this chamber is connected to the bottom of the drum via a sealed air tube.</p></li><li><p>As the water fills the drum, the air inside the trap compresses, increasing the internal pressure, which is detected by the HX710B module.</p></li><li><p>A simple Arduino sketch continuously read the digital values from the HX710B and compared them against predefined setpoints.</p></li><li><p>Calibration was performed manually using graduated containers to add specific volumes of water. I logged corresponding sensor readings to correlate digital values with actual water levels (e.g., 6L, 12L, 18L).</p></li></ul><hr><hr><h2 id=-transitioning-to-esp32-platform>🔁 Transitioning to ESP32 Platform</h2><ul><li>Once the core testing of motor control and actuator behavior was completed, I shifted focus to building a more intelligent, fully programmable controller. This began with selecting the appropriate microcontroller platform.</li></ul><p><strong>Microcontroller Selection:</strong></p><ul><li>After estimating the number of GPIOs required for relay modules, sensors, communication interfaces, and feedback mechanisms, I finalized the ESP32 as the brain of the system.</li></ul><p><strong>The ESP32 provided:</strong></p><ul><li>Dual-core processing for multitasking wash logic and communications.</li><li>Sufficient digital I/O and ADC inputs.</li><li>Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, enabling smart integration features.</li></ul><p><strong>Platform Setup and Firmware Development:</strong></p><ul><li>I opted for the ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) to build the firmware, ensuring full control and lower-level access compared to Arduino Core.</li></ul><p><strong>Initial libraries integrated:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>HX711/HX710B</strong> for water level sensing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Telegram Bot</strong> Library to push real-time updates to my personal Telegram bot.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wire / I2C / GPIO</strong> drivers for low-level control of peripherals.</p></li><li><p><strong>WebServer</strong> Library for Endpoint control, and OTA Update Framework.</p></li><li><p><strong>ElegantOTA</strong> Library for Backend OTA Handling.</p></li><li><p><strong>LiquidCrystalI2C</strong> Library for Displaying text on 16x2 LCD.</p></li><li><p><strong>Espalexa Library</strong> for Remote Device Control.</p></li><li><p>All control logic — including PWM generation, relay sequencing, safety interlocks, and mode switching — was implemented as tasks within the ESP32’s FreeRTOS framework.</p></li></ul><hr><hr><h2 id=-mechanical-load-testing>🧱 Mechanical Load Testing</h2><ul><li>With firmware ready and control logic functional, I moved on to real-world mechanical stress testing to validate the full load capabilities of the inverter drive and the motor.</li></ul><p><strong>⚙️ Full Drum Load Testing:</strong></p><ul><li>I mounted the motor inside the washing drum, reassembled the mechanical linkage, and filled the drum with clothes and water to simulate real conditions.</li><li>Using different PWM duty cycles, I controlled the motor through wash, rinse, and spin modes.</li><li>Peak power output observed was approximately 350W sustained, with startup torque high enough that manual interruption was impossible — indicating the IPM was operating optimally.</li></ul><p><strong>🚨 Error Handling Observations:</strong></p><ul><li>During testing, unexpected shutdowns occurred.

No schematics, no documentation, no datasheets. Just a 325V input and a four-pin connector to a washing machine motor. Through painstaking trial and error, I reverse-engineered:</p><ul><li><strong>The function of feedback pins.</strong></li><li><strong>How the module self-starts after a 10-minute delay.</strong></li><li><strong>How it interprets PWM signals for speed control.</strong></li></ul><p>This eventually led to block diagrams, signal maps, and logic sequences that were key to system integration.</p><hr><p><strong>2. 🔄Motor Direction and Speed Control</strong></p><p>Getting the motor to spin wasn’t enough. Controlling its direction and speed was the next major challenge.</p><ul><li><strong>Direction control required safe relay-based phase inversion.</strong></li><li><strong>Speed control required precise PWM signal timing.</strong></li></ul><p>I went through dozens of PWM timing experiments, finally landing on a sweet spot that gave the motor smooth acceleration without tripping inverter protections.</p><hr><p><strong>3. 🌊 Water Level Control Loop Failures</strong></p><p>The HX710B sensor used for measuring drum pressure occasionally gave erratic or drifting values, which caused:</p><ul><li><strong>Preemptive termination of water fill.</strong></li><li><strong>Overfilling with no cutoff.</strong></li></ul><p>I solved this <strong>by</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Stabilizing digital readings.</strong></li><li><strong>Averaging the values across multiple samples.</strong></li><li><strong>Introducing double-threshold hysteresis logic to avoid rapid toggling.</strong></li></ul><hr><p><strong>4. 🕒 Relay Changeover Interference with IPM</strong></p><p>The changeover relays used to reverse motor direction were affecting the IPM drive. During relay switching, the IPM would falsely detect a short circuit or open-load fault, triggering shutdown.</p><p>The <strong>solution</strong> involved:</p><ul><li><strong>Temporarily disabling PWM output just before switching the relay.</strong></li><li><strong>Adding short time delays (ms scale) to prevent logic conflicts.</strong></li></ul><hr><p><strong>5. ⏱️ Watchdog Timer Interrupts</strong></p><p>A mysterious reboot issue plagued the early firmware. The ESP32 would randomly reset, often during display status updates or Wi-Fi activity.
The culprit was the Watchdog Timer (WDT) triggered by a non-responsive LED status task.</p><p>I fixed <strong>this</strong> by:</p><ul><li><strong>Restructuring the task into non-blocking logic.</strong></li><li><strong>Feeding the watchdog manually at safe checkpoints.</strong></li></ul><hr><p><strong>6. 🚫 Spin Cycle Motor Lock Detection</strong></p><p>When the tub was filled with wet, heavy clothes, the motor would often fail to spin up. The IPM interpreted this as a motor lockup condition and shut off power immediately.</p><p>I <strong>resolved</strong> this by:</p><ul><li><strong>Altering the shunt resistor scaling.</strong></li><li><strong>Filtering out sudden current spikes that falsely triggered the OCP logic.</strong></li></ul><hr><p><strong>7. 🧺 Unbalanced Load During Spin Start</strong></p><p>After the rinse or wash cycle, once water drained and spin was initiated, the initial jerk caused imbalanced clothes to bang against the drum. The system lacked a low-speed balance detection mechanism <strong>because:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The IPM Drive offered no 1 RPM-level fine control.</strong></li><li><strong>There was no gyroscope or vibration feedback loop.</strong></li></ul><p>The only permanent solution would be to design a custom inverter drive with full low-speed control and dynamic load balancing.</p><hr><p><strong>8. ⚡ Unexpected Inverter Shutdowns & Self-Power-On Events</strong></p><p>Intermittently, the IPM module <strong>would:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shut down during phase changeovers.</strong></li><li><strong>Restart automatically after long delays, even when not commanded.</strong></li></ul><p>This erratic behavior was difficult to reproduce and remains partially unexplained — likely caused by internal auto-restart logic or control pin float issues. Proper pull-down resistors and debounce delays are planned for future fixes.</p><hr><p><strong>9. 🔄 Real-Time Water Level Monitoring Integration</strong></p><p>Developing a unified function that <strong>simultaneously:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Monitored water level.</strong></li><li><strong>Triggered inlet control.</strong></li><li><strong>Prevented overflow.</strong></li><li><strong>Integrated manual override.</strong></li></ul><p>…was a huge design effort. It required nested conditions, multiple interrupt scenarios, and continual calibration.</p><hr><p><strong>10. 🖥️ User Interface Design & Display Formatting</strong></p><p>Displaying system state on a 16x2 LCD (or I2C variant) turned out to be unexpectedly complex.
Challenges <strong>included:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fitting multiline prompts within 16 characters.</strong></li><li><strong>Preventing display flicker during rapid updates.</strong></li><li><strong>Designing a readable and intuitive menu/UI flow.</strong></li></ul><p>Each parameter shown — from current mode, to water level, to spin state — had to be dynamically refreshed without blocking the control loop.</p><hr><hr><h2 id=-final-system-behavior>🧼 Final System Behavior</h2><p>The final system, after extensive R&amp;D, testing, and integration, behaves as a fully self-regulating, smart IoT-based appliance. Designed with both manual and smart capabilities, the washing machine now performs autonomously — while also offering granular user feedback via physical indicators, LCD, and remote messaging.</p><p>Here’s a detailed description of how the system behaves from the moment it powers on to the completion of a wash program:</p><p><strong>🔌 1. Power-On Initialization</strong></p><p>Upon supplying power to the system, the green ring LED surrounding the main power button lights up steadily.
Simultaneously, the 16x2 LCD displays a welcome screen:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>    Advanced IoT 
  Washing Machine
</code></pre><p>Four dedicated LEDs labeled Soak, Wash, Rinse, Spin illuminate briefly in a sweeping pattern to indicate boot sequence.
The ESP32 begins initializing all core modules — GPIOs, sensors, relays, display, and Wi-Fi stack.</p><hr><p><strong>📶 2. Wi-Fi Connectivity & Smart Mode Check</strong></p><p>During Wi-Fi connection attempt, the green ring LED blinks at 1-second intervals, visually indicating that the system is attempting to go online.</p><p>If Wi-Fi is connected successfully:</p><ul><li>The ring LED turns solid green.</li><li>A boot success message is pushed via Telegram Bot API.</li><li>Smart features such as remote control, OTA, and voice assistant integration are enabled.</li></ul><p>If Wi-Fi fails:</p><p>The ring LED turns off.
The machine enters offline fallback mode where only manual control is available.</p><hr><p><strong>🧺 3. Program Selection Logic</strong></p><p>The user can press any of the physical buttons to select a program: Wash, Rinse, or Spin</p><p>Once a program is selected:</p><ul><li>The corresponding LED stays lit.</li></ul><p>A 10-second grace period is activated, during which:</p><ul><li>The user can cancel the operation or select a different mode.</li><li>If interrupted, all LEDs are reset, and system returns to idle.</li><li>After 10 seconds of no change, the selected program is locked in and begins execution.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>🚿 4. Water Filling & Level Monitoring</strong></p><ul><li>Most programs begin with water intake via the solenoid inlet valve.</li><li>The HX710B pressure sensor reads real-time air pressure from the drum&rsquo;s air trap system.</li><li>The current water level (in liters) is displayed on the LCD.</li><li>Once the target level is reached, the inlet valve is turned off.</li></ul><p>✅ If Wi-Fi is active, a message is sent to the Telegram bot such as:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>&#34;Program: Wash Started | Target Water: 12.0L&#34;
&#34;Filling... Current Level: 7.5L&#34;
</code></pre><hr><p><strong>🌀 5. Agitation, Rinse, and Spin Execution</strong></p><p>Based on selected mode, the drum is driven through timed sequences using:</p><ul><li>Directional control via changeover relays</li><li>Speed control via PWM signal to the inverter drive</li></ul><p>Modes:</p><ul><li>Soak: Fill Water and light movement of clothes over a long period of time.</li><li>Wash: Clockwise and counter-clockwise cycles with staggered delays.</li><li>Rinse: Refill water, agitate lightly, drain.</li><li>Spin: Full-speed single direction motor run with drain valve open.</li></ul><p>The LCD displays:</p><ul><li>Current stage (e.g., Washing: Stage 2 of 3).</li><li>Elapsed time.</li><li>System status or error if any.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>💬 6. Real-Time Remote Feedback</strong></p><p>During each stage transition or sensor threshold trigger, a status update is sent to Telegram:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>&#34;Spin Cycle Started | RPM: 950 | Load: Balanced ✅&#34;
&#34;Rinse Completed | Drain: Successful&#34;
</code></pre><p>All telemetry is also recorded for later data analytics and visualization (future scope).</p><hr><p><strong>🧘 7. Post-Cycle & Idle Mode</strong></p><p>Once the selected cycle is completed:</p><ul><li>All relays are turned off.</li><li>Inverter drive is disabled.</li><li>The final water level, wash duration, and energy usage are logged.</li></ul><p>A Telegram message confirms completion:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>✅ Wash Cycle Completed
Total Water Used: 18.0L
Duration: 00:24:32
Power: 350W
</code></pre><ul><li>The machine then returns to idle mode, ready for the next input.</li><li>If left untouched, the system maintains low-power state and periodically checks for OTA updates or new commands.</li></ul><hr><hr><h2 id=-gallery--media>🖼️ Gallery & Media</h2><p>Below are some photos and media captured during the 1-year long development and testing process of the smart washing machine retrofit project.</p><p>Click on the text, and it will lead to indivisual photos and videos inside the google Photos Album.
