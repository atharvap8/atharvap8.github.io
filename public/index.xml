They are fundamental building blocks of modern electronics, drastically reducing size and improving the performance of electronic devices.
History The invention of the IC can be traced back to Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor. Kilby successfully demonstrated the first working IC in 1958, and Noyce made significant contributions to its practical development.</description></item><item><title>Study of Potentiometers</title><link>https://atharvap8.github.io/posts/2024/10/study-of-potentiometers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 00:26:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://atharvap8.github.io/posts/2024/10/study-of-potentiometers/</guid><description>Potentiometers: Study Notes 1. Introduction to Potentiometers A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. The primary use of a potentiometer is to vary the resistance in a circuit without interrupting the flow of current. It is commonly used for adjusting electrical devices like volume controls on audio equipment.
Types of Potentiometers: Rotary Potentiometer: Has a circular rotation for adjusting resistance.</description></item><item><title>Esp32 Washing Machine</title><link>https://atharvap8.github.io/posts/2024/07/esp32-washing-machine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 18:00:32 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://atharvap8.github.io/posts/2024/07/esp32-washing-machine/</guid><description>Coming SOON!</description></item><item><title>Automatic Water Tap V2</title><link>https://atharvap8.github.io/posts/2024/06/automatic-water-tap-v2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 12:57:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://atharvap8.github.io/posts/2024/06/automatic-water-tap-v2/</guid><description>Introduction In this project, I have built an IR Sensor-based automatic water tap. This system allows water to flow when it detects an object in front of the sensor, making it a convenient and hygienic solution for home or public restrooms. The IR sensor is mounted on the tap head to detect any objects near the water tap.

The controller is based on the ESP32 module, which works as the central brain. It manages all the data processing, communication &amp;amp; feedback, and manages I/O in the system. The system includes buck converters, power supply, and relays for actuator control. It utilizes an inverter drive to control the motor speed and direction, with a changeover relay configuration to manage the motor’s rotational direction.</description></item><item><title>chatper-name</title><link>https://atharvap8.github.io/posts/2024/02/chatper-name/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2024 16:30:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://atharvap8.github.io/posts/2024/02/chatper-name/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ble Car Security Controller</title><link>https://atharvap8.github.io/posts/2024/01/ble-car-security-controller/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 17:07:33 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://atharvap8.github.io/posts/2024/01/ble-car-security-controller/</guid><description>Central Locking and Security Controller for Wagon R with ESP32 and BLE Introduction This project showcases the development of a central locking and security controller for the Wagon R car, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The system is based on an ESP32 microcontroller that handles key functionalities such as door signal control, bonnet status, indicators, and alarm settings.
