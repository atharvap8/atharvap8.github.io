Electronics involves the study and application of electrical components to control the flow of electricity. Fundamental concepts include voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R), governed by Ohm&amp;rsquo;s Law: ( V = IR ). Key Concepts:
Voltage: The potential difference driving current in a circuit. Current: The flow of electric charge. Resistance: Opposition to current flow. Questions:
What is Ohm&amp;rsquo;s Law, and how is it used in basic circuit analysis?</description></item><item><title>Study of MOSFETs</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/10/study-of-mosfets/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2024 09:43:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/10/study-of-mosfets/</guid><description>MOSFET - Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor Introduction The MOSFET is a crucial semiconductor device widely used for switching and amplifying electronic signals. Known for its efficiency, speed, and small size, it is a primary building block of modern electronics, forming the foundation for integrated circuits in everything from computers to communication devices.
Brief History The first MOSFET was developed in 1959 by engineers Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs. This innovation revolutionized the field of electronics, as it allowed for much smaller, faster, and more efficient circuits compared to previous technologies like bipolar junction transistors (BJTs).</description></item><item><title>Study of ICs</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/10/study-of-ics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2024 00:26:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/10/study-of-ics/</guid><description>Introduction to Integrated Circuits Integrated Circuits (ICs) are miniature electronic devices that contain multiple transistors, diodes, capacitors, and resistors integrated onto a single chip of semiconductor material, usually silicon. They are fundamental building blocks of modern electronics, drastically reducing size and improving the performance of electronic devices.
History The invention of the IC can be traced back to Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor. Kilby successfully demonstrated the first working IC in 1958, and Noyce made significant contributions to its practical development.</description></item><item><title>Study of Potentiometers</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/10/study-of-potentiometers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 00:26:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/10/study-of-potentiometers/</guid><description>Potentiometers: Study Notes 1. Introduction to Potentiometers A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. The primary use of a potentiometer is to vary the resistance in a circuit without interrupting the flow of current. It is commonly used for adjusting electrical devices like volume controls on audio equipment.
Types of Potentiometers: Rotary Potentiometer: Has a circular rotation for adjusting resistance.</description></item><item><title>Esp32 Washing Machine</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/07/esp32-washing-machine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 18:00:32 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/07/esp32-washing-machine/</guid><description>Coming SOON!</description></item><item><title>Automatic Water Tap V2</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/06/automatic-water-tap-v2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 12:57:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/06/automatic-water-tap-v2/</guid><description>Introduction In this project, I have built an IR Sensor-based automatic water tap. This system allows water to flow when it detects an object in front of the sensor, making it a convenient and hygienic solution for home or public restrooms. The IR sensor is mounted on the tap head to detect any objects near the water tap.
