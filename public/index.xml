This system allows water to flow when it detects an object in front of the sensor, making it a convenient and hygienic solution for home or public restrooms. The IR sensor is mounted on the tap head to detect any objects near the water tap.

The controller is based on the ESP32 module, which works as the central brain. It manages all the data processing, communication &amp;amp; feedback, and manages I/O in the system. The system includes buck converters, power supply, and relays for actuator control. It utilizes an inverter drive to control the motor speed and direction, with a changeover relay configuration to manage the motor‚Äôs rotational direction.</description></item><item><title>chatper-name</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/02/chatper-name/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2024 16:30:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/02/chatper-name/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ble Car Security Controller</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/01/ble-car-security-controller/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 17:07:33 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/01/ble-car-security-controller/</guid><description>Central Locking and Security Controller for Wagon R with ESP32 and BLE Introduction This project showcases the development of a central locking and security controller for the Wagon R car, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The system is based on an ESP32 microcontroller that handles key functionalities such as door signal control, bonnet status, indicators, and alarm settings. It is designed to work with a smartphone or a dedicated transmitter (built using the Xiao ESP32C3 board).</description></item><item><title>Iot Gas Safety System</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/01/iot-gas-safety-system/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 17:27:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/01/iot-gas-safety-system/</guid><description>Introduction In this project, we will build a comprehensive gas safety system designed to enhance household safety by monitoring gas leaks and taking automatic corrective actions. The system controls an exhaust fan, operates a servo motor to turn off the gas regulator, and sends notifications via email and popup alerts. Designed with robustness, fireproofing, data retention, and false alarm prevention in mind, this device provides reliable and continuous gas monitoring. Perfect for safety-conscious homeowners or DIY enthusiasts, this project helps to prevent potential hazards.</description></item><item><title>About me, and this website</title><link>http://localhost:1313/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m Atharva Phadke, Passionate IoT Engineering student with a strong foundation in electronics, developed from hands-on experience starting at a young age.
