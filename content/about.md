I'm **Atharva Phadke**, Passionate IoT Engineering student with a strong foundation in electronics, developed from hands-on experience starting at a young age. Completed several projects in IoT, embedded systems, and electronics, including an IoT gas safety system, ESP32-based washing machines, BLE car security controller, and Alexa home automation system. With over 3 years of practical experience working in an electronics shop and continuous self-driven learning, I bring a deep interest in innovation and problem-solving in the field of electronics and IoT.Currrently on the verge of understanding how basic and complicated systems/machines/objects work in real life. I always like to take everything apart, and learn practically, how each component works in conjunction to each other, to fullfil a specific task or function.
