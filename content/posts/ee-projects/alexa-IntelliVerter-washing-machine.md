## Introduction

In this project, we will build a smart controller for a washing machine. The controller is based on the ESP32 module, which works as the central brain. It manages all the data processing, communication & feedback, and manages I/O in the system. The system includes buck converters, power supply, and relays for actuator control. It utilizes an inverter drive to control the motor speed and direction, with a changeover relay configuration to manage the motorâ€™s rotational direction. Also it includes a 16x2 display, and pushbuttons, for program control, and LEDs for status indication. All wash programs are embedded within the microcontroller, and the system is designed for easy further development, allowing changes to be made according to user requirements.
This project brings IoT functionality to washing machines, offering voice control, remote monitoring & feedback for convenience and efficiency.

## How It Works

The smart washing machine controller has a ESP32 module, at its core, which manages all the functionality. It receives all inputs, manages outputs, manages timing, and signal control, output control, and Serial Communication. The main PCB houses the ESP32, some voltage converters, power supply, and connectors for each discrete sensor / device. 
There is also a secondary PCB, which is called Inverter Drive Board. As the name suggests, its a inverter drive used to control the motor, and manage its parameters. The ESP32 provides speed & direction signals to the board. For changover action, and to control some actuators, relays are present, which are direct driven by ESP32. I have used 
all these components in their modular form, and have used Berg Connectors for easy part replacement and repair.

## Step-by-Step Making Guide

### Step 1: Documentation, and design
Starting with schematic diagram, and component selection, we move forward to making the design, of the whole assembly.

### Step 2: Assembly 
Start by connecting every part on the PCB / perfboard, then connect the pin headers for the specific sensors / devices, actuators, power supply, etc.

### Step 3: Program the ESP32  
Edit the credentials in the given code, and then upload it to ESP32, and verify every connection atleast 2 times before first powerup. 

### Step 4: Calibration & Adjustments
After initial powerup, manual calibration needs to be done, for the water level sensor to work properly. adjusting the float parameter of water sensor with the actual 0 reference, confirms that it is calibrated successfully.

### Step 5: Final Installation and Testing  
After assembling the PCB and programming the ESP32, install the controller in the washing machine. Connect the motor, sensors, and other peripherals to the system and run tests to ensure the washing programs work correctly, including voice commands and Telegram updates. It is beneficial to use modular connectors (but with proper connection strength) to ensure no loose connects, and a hassle free replacement process.
