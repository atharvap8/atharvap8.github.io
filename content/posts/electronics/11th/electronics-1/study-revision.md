### **1: Introduction to Electronics**
**Description:**
- Electronics involves the study and application of electrical components to control the flow of electricity.
- Fundamental concepts include **voltage (V)**, **current (I)**, and **resistance (R)**, governed by Ohm's Law: \( V = IR \).
- 

**Key Concepts:**
- **Voltage**: The potential difference driving current in a circuit.
- **Current**: The flow of electric charge.
- **Resistance**: Opposition to current flow.

**Questions:**
1. What is Ohm's Law, and how is it used in basic circuit analysis?
2. What is the difference between series and parallel circuits in terms of current and voltage?
3. Explain the role of a breadboard in circuit design and testing.
4. Why does total resistance decrease in parallel circuits?
