## Theory
 - A bridge rectifier is an electronic circuit that converts an alternating current (AC) input into a direct current (DC) output. 
 - The rectifier circuit consists of four diodes arranged in a bridge configuration. The AC input is applied to the diagonals of the bridge, and the DC output is taken from the center of the bridge. 
 - During the positive half cycle of the AC input, diodes D1 and D2 conduct and provide a positive output. 
 - During the negative half cycle of the AC input, diodes D3 and D4 conduct and provide a negative output. 
 - The DC output is a pulsed signal, which can be smoothed using a filter capacitor to obtain a pure DC signal. 
 - The bridge rectifier is a simple, efficient, and cost-effective solution for converting AC to DC.
 - The bridge rectifier circuit is commonly used in power supplies, chargers, and other applications where a DC output is required. T The bridge rectifier is a versatile circuit that can be used in many applications, making it an important component in the field of electronics.

 ### Advantages
 - The main advantage of a bridge rectifier over a half-wave rectifier is that it utilizes both positive and negative cycles of the AC input, resulting in a higher efficiency and a more regulated DC output. 
 - The use of four diodes provides full-wave rectification, which results in a higher DC output compared to a half-wave rectifier.
 - The bridge rectifier circuit can also be used to isolate the DC output from the AC input, providing electrical isolation and protection to the load.
