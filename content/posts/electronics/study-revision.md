## **Fundamentals of Electronics and Components**

---

### **1: Introduction to Electronics**
**Description:**
- Electronics involves the study and application of electrical components to control the flow of electricity.
- Fundamental concepts include **voltage (V)**, **current (I)**, and **resistance (R)**, governed by Ohm's Law: \( V = IR \).
- Statement: The voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing thru it, and inverse the resistance of the conductor itself.


**Key Concepts:**
- **Voltage**: The potential difference driving current in a circuit.
- **Current**: The flow of electric charge.
- **Resistance**: Opposition to current flow.

**Questions:**
1. What is Ohm's Law, and how is it used in basic circuit analysis?
2. What is the difference between series and parallel circuits in terms of current and voltage?
Ans: In parallel circuit, voltage across all components is same, but current is different.
In Series circuit, voltage across all the components is different, but current is same.
3. Explain the role of a breadboard in circuit design and testing.
4. Why does total resistance decrease in parallel circuits?
