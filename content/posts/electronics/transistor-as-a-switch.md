## Theory
A transistor can be used as a switch to control the flow of current in a circuit. The transistor operates in two modes: cut-off and saturation. In the cut-off mode, the transistor acts as an open switch, and no current flows through the circuit. In saturation, the transistor acts as a closed switch, and maximum current flows through the circuit. By adjusting the current applied to the base terminal of the transistor, we can control the flow of current in the circuit.

## Procedure
1. Connect the transistor to the breadboard as per the circuit diagram.

2. Connect the power supply to the circuit.

3. Apply a small current to the base terminal of the transistor to observe the flow of current through the circuit.

4. Increase the current applied to the base terminal and observe the effect on the flow of current through the circuit.

5. Observe the effect of the resistance value on the flow of current through the circuit.
